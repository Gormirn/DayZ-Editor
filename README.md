# DayZ Editor

The DayZ Editor is a 3D Map editing tool. Designed for creating environments, playing with mechanics, or just general fooling around (we even have a paint brush for trees!)

**REUPLOAD / REPACKING WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. ALL VERSIONS FOUND ON THE WORKSHOP WILL BE ACTIONED AND YOUR STEAM ACCOUNT WILL BE BLACKLISTED FROM EDITOR USAGE**
